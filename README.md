# Nand2Tetris

This repo documents my solutions to the nand2tetris course in which students build a fully working computer including
the hardware and software starting from only Nand gates.

The associated website is available here: [From Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

## Logic Visualizations

The course includes a custom VHDL and design IDE. However, I also implemented most of the logic structures (up to the
limitations of the visualization software) in Logicly, a visual logic application.

Some of the structures can be seen below.

### Half Adder

### Full Adder

### 16-bit Adder

### Arithmetic Logic Unit

### Program Counter

### Full CPU

### 1-bit Register

### 16-bit Register

### RAM64

### RAM64 Package
